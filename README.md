# H4X0R-news

this is an application that uses SwiftUI. I used an API from Algolia. This application gets the forum results from the API. 
When clicking on any of the items in the list, it will take you to a web view which will display the article that was linked in the item.
I used the ObservableObject Protocol to subscribe to changes from the API
